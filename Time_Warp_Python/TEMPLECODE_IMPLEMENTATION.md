# Time Warp Python Port - TempleCode Implementation

## Overview

The Python port has been updated to match the Rust implementation's **TempleCode** unified language approach. All three languages (BASIC, PILOT, Logo) can now be freely mixed in a single program.

## What Changed

### 1. Unified Language Detection
- **Before**: Separate language modes, required explicit selection
- **After**: Automatic detection per command, seamless mixing

### 2. Command Precedence (matching Rust)
Detection order:
1. **PILOT syntax** (X: pattern) - `T:`, `A:`, `J:`, `L:`, etc.
2. **Logo procedures** - User-defined procedures (highest priority for custom commands)
3. **Logo keywords** - Turtle graphics commands (FORWARD, LEFT, SETXY, etc.)
4. **BASIC keywords** - Including PRINT, LET, IF, FOR, GOTO, etc.
5. **Default** - PILOT (for unknown commands)

### 3. PRINT Command
- **BASIC now handles PRINT** (not Logo)
- Strips quotes from string literals: `PRINT "Hello"` → `Hello`
- Evaluates variables and expressions: `PRINT X` → `5`
- Handles comma-separated items: `PRINT "Value:", X` → `Value: 5`

### 4. Language Enum
Added `Language.TEMPLECODE` to represent the unified language mode.

File extensions:
- `.tc`, `.temple`, `.templecode` → TempleCode
- `.pilot`, `.pil` → PILOT
- `.bas`, `.basic` → BASIC  
- `.logo`, `.lgo` → Logo

## Current Test Results

**PILOT**: ✅ 7/7 commands (100%)
**Logo**: ✅ 19/19 commands (100%)  
**BASIC**: ⚠️ 7/11 commands (64%)
  - ✅ Working: PRINT, LET, GOSUB/RETURN, REM, CLS, SCREEN, LOCATE
  - ❌ Need fixes: GOTO, IF/THEN, FOR/NEXT, END

**Overall**: 33/37 commands (89%)

## Example TempleCode Program

```templecode
REM Mix all three languages!
T:Welcome to Time Warp IDE

LET X = 10
PRINT "BASIC variable:", X

T:Now drawing with Logo...
FORWARD 100
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 100

PRINT "Done!"
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining BASIC commands (GOTO, IF/THEN, FOR/NEXT, END)
2. Update UI to show "TempleCode" as language name
3. Add comprehensive examples demonstrating unified language
4. Update documentation to explain TempleCode philosophy

## Compatibility with Rust Version

The Python implementation now matches the Rust version's approach:
- ✅ Unified language execution
- ✅ Same command precedence order
- ✅ Identical PRINT behavior
- ✅ Mixed-language programs work identically
- ⚠️ Some BASIC control flow commands still need implementation

## Files Modified

- `time_warp/core/interpreter.py` - Added TempleCode language enum, fixed detection order
- `time_warp/languages/basic.py` - Rewrote PRINT to match Rust implementation
- `time_warp/languages/logo.py` - Updated PRINT for string literal handling
- `examples/demo_templecode.tc` - Created demo showing unified language

## Philosophy

TempleCode represents an **educational philosophy**: Instead of forcing students to choose ONE programming paradigm, let them use the best tool for each task:

- **PILOT** for interactive text adventures and quizzes
- **BASIC** for variables, logic, and calculations  
- **Logo** for visual creativity and turtle graphics

All in ONE program, ONE environment, seamlessly integrated.
