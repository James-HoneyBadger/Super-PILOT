# Archived Status Documents

**Date Archived:** October 28, 2025  
**Reason:** Documentation consolidation - superseded by STATUS.md

---

## Overview

The following status documents have been **archived** because they contain outdated information that no longer reflects the current state of the project. All relevant current information has been consolidated into **STATUS.md**.

---

## Archived Documents

### 1. PYTHON_PORT_STATUS.md
**Status:** Outdated  
**Issue:** Shows many components as "ðŸš§ TO CREATE" when they are actually 100% complete
- Claims `error_hints.py`, `languages/*.py`, `compiler/*.py`, `ui/*.py` need to be created
- Reality: All these files exist and are fully functional
- Line counts are incorrect (465 lines claimed, actual is different)
- **Superseded by:** STATUS.md

### 2. GUI_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
**Status:** Mostly accurate but redundant  
**Issue:** Duplicates information now in STATUS.md and README.md
- Accurate component breakdown (1,460 lines GUI code)
- Feature list matches reality
- No unique information not covered elsewhere
- **Superseded by:** STATUS.md (Component Completion section) + README.md

### 3. PROJECT_COMPLETE.md
**Status:** Mostly accurate but outdated details  
**Issue:** Some line counts and percentages differ from current
- Claims "100% complete" but some details inconsistent
- Line counts may be outdated (needs verification)
- Test suite status outdated (claims 5 tests, reality is more)
- **Superseded by:** STATUS.md + README.md

### 4. IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
**Status:** Accurate implementation summary but redundant  
**Issue:** Duplicates technical details now in STATUS.md
- Excellent technical breakdown of each module
- Component descriptions are accurate
- LOC counts may be outdated
- **Superseded by:** STATUS.md (Feature Checklist section)

### 5. VERIFICATION_REPORT.md
**Status:** Accurate verification but outdated counts  
**Issue:** Example count wrong (claims 32, actually 34)
- All verification results still accurate
- Theme count should be 9 not 8 (missing Forest theme)
- Otherwise good verification document
- **Superseded by:** STATUS.md (Testing Status section)

### 6. TEMPLECODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md
**Status:** Accurate historical record  
**Issue:** Documents the *transition* to unified TempleCode, not current status
- Useful for understanding the architectural decision
- "Next Steps" section is outdated (BASIC commands now work)
- Test results (89% passing) are outdated (now 100%)
- **Keep as historical reference** or merge into ARCHITECTURE.md

## Migration Summary

### Information Preserved

All unique and current information from these documents has been consolidated into:

1. **STATUS.md** - Comprehensive current status
   - Component completion table (100% across the board)
   - Correct package structure
   - Feature checklist with all 50+ turtle commands
   - Testing status (5 scripts, 60% coverage estimate)
   - Documentation roadmap
   - Python vs Rust comparison
   - Next steps priorities
   - LOC breakdown (~4000 lines)

2. **README.md** - User-facing documentation
   - Overview of both implementations
   - Installation instructions
   - Quick start guide
   - Feature highlights
   - API usage examples

3. **QUICKSTART.md** - Getting started guide
   - Installation steps
   - IDE features walkthrough
   - Example program list (all 34 programs)
   - Troubleshooting

4. **DESKTOP_QUICKSTART.md** - Desktop IDE guide
   - Interface overview
   - Theme showcase (9 themes)
   - Keyboard shortcuts
   - Tips and tricks

### Information Discarded

- Outdated "TO CREATE" task lists
- Incorrect line counts
- Old percentage completions
- Superseded technical details

### Historical Value

**TEMPLECODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md** should be kept or merged into architecture docs as it explains the important design decision to unify BASIC, PILOT, and Logo into a single TempleCode language.

All other documents can be safely deleted or moved to an `archive/` directory.

## Recommended Actions

1. **Delete or move to archive/**
   - PYTHON_PORT_STATUS.md
   - GUI_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
   - PROJECT_COMPLETE.md
   - IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md
   - VERIFICATION_REPORT.md

2. **Keep or merge**
   - TEMPLECODE_IMPLEMENTATION.md â†’ Merge into ARCHITECTURE.md or keep as historical reference

3. **Primary references going forward**
   - STATUS.md - Implementation status
   - README.md - Project overview
   - QUICKSTART.md - Getting started
   - DESKTOP_QUICKSTART.md - IDE guide

---

## Notes

This consolidation eliminates documentation fragmentation and conflicting status information. All current project status is now maintained in a single source of truth (STATUS.md) with user-facing docs (README, QUICKSTART) providing appropriate detail for different audiences.
