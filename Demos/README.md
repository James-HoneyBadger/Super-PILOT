**SuperPILOT Complete Demo Program**

This is the ultimate demonstration of SuperPILOT's full feature set, including:

### PILOT Language Features:
- Text output with variable interpolation (`T:`)
- User input (`A:`)
- Variable assignment (`U:`)
- Conditional logic (`Y:`/`N:`)
- Labels and jumps (`L:`/`J:`)
- Subroutines (`R:`/`C:`)

### BASIC Language Features:
- Variable assignment (`LET`)
- Screen output (`PRINT`)
- User input (`INPUT`)
- Conditional execution (`IF`/`THEN`)
- Loops (`FOR`/`NEXT`)
- Subroutines (`GOSUB`/`RETURN`)

### Logo Graphics Features:
- Turtle movement (`FORWARD`, `BACK`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`)
- Position control (`SETXY`, `SETX`, `SETY`, `HOME`)
- Pen control (`PENUP`, `PENDOWN`, `PENCOLOR`, `PENSIZE`)
- Visibility (`HIDETURTLE`, `SHOWTURTLE`)
- Screen control (`CLEARSCREEN`, `CLEARTEXT`)
- Repetition (`REPEAT` with nested brackets)
- Custom procedures (`TO`/`END`)

### Advanced Features:
- Expression evaluation with variables and functions
- Nested control structures
- Complex graphics patterns
- Interactive user experience

### How to Run:
1. Open SuperPILOT IDE
2. Load `Demos/complete_demo.spt`
3. Click "Run"
4. Follow the prompts and watch the graphics!

The demo will guide you through each feature category and create beautiful graphics patterns including spirals, stars, flowers, and houses.

### Expected Output:
- Interactive text-based introduction
- Math demonstrations
- User input handling
- Conditional responses
- Loop calculations (factorial)
