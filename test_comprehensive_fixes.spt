T:=== Comprehensive Fix Verification ===
T:
T:Test 1: String variables with $
INPUT "Enter your name: "; name$
T:Your name is: *name$*
T:
T:Test 2: A: command with $ variable
A:color$
T:Your color: *color$*
T:
T:Test 3: Undefined numeric variable (should default to 0)
T:factorial_num at start: *factorial_num*
LET factorial_num = 5
T:factorial_num after assignment: *factorial_num*
T:
T:Test 4: Expression with undefined var
LET result = factorial_num + undefined_var
T:Result (5 + 0): *result*
T:
T:Test 5: Mixed $ and normalized variables
INPUT "Enter age: "; age$
T:Age as string: *age$*
LET numeric_age = age$
T:Age as number: *numeric_age*
T:
T:Test 6: Verify no minimap appears
T:(Check visually - should be no middle pane)
T:
T:Test 7: Input field location
T:(Input field should appear at BOTTOM of output, not in terminal)
T:
T:=== ALL TESTS COMPLETE ===
T:If you see this message with correct values above,
T:and the input field appeared in the IDE (not terminal),
T:then all fixes are working correctly!
