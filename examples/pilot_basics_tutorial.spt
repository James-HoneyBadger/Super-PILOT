REM Step 1: Introduction
1000 PRINT "=== Step 1: Introduction to PILOT ==="
PRINT
PRINT "PILOT (Programmed Instruction, Learning, Or Teaching)"
PRINT "is designed for educational programming."
PRINT
PRINT "PILOT programs use simple commands that start with letters:"
PRINT "T: - Type (display text)"
PRINT "A: - Accept (get input)"
PRINT "L: - Label (mark locations)"
PRINT "U: - Update (assign variables)"
PRINT "Y: - Yes (conditional test)"
PRINT "N: - No (alternative conditional)"
PRINT "J: - Jump (goto label)"
PRINT "END - End program"
PRINT

REM Step 2: First Program
1100 PRINT "=== Step 2: Your First PILOT Program ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Let's create a simple 'Hello World' program."
PRINT
PRINT "Type this program in the editor:"
PRINT
PRINT "T:Hello, World!"
PRINT "T:Welcome to PILOT programming!"
PRINT "END"
PRINT
PRINT "Commands explained:"
PRINT "T: - tells PILOT to display text"
PRINT "END - marks the end of the program"
PRINT
PRINT "Run this program and observe the output."

REM Step 3: Adding Input
1200 PRINT "=== Step 3: Getting User Input ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Programs become interactive when they accept user input."
PRINT
PRINT "Try this enhanced program:"
PRINT
PRINT "T:What's your name?"
PRINT "A:NAME"
PRINT "T:Hello, *NAME*! Nice to meet you!"
PRINT "END"
PRINT
PRINT "Commands explained:"
PRINT "A:NAME - accepts input and stores it in variable NAME"
PRINT "*NAME* - displays the value of variable NAME"
PRINT
PRINT "Run the program and enter your name when prompted."
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 4: Variables
1300 PRINT "=== Step 4: Working with Variables ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Variables store information for later use."

PRINT "END"
PRINT
PRINT "Commands explained:"
PRINT "U: - assigns values to variables"
PRINT "Variables can store numbers or text"
PRINT "Use *VARIABLE* to insert variable values in text"
PRINT
PRINT "Try changing the values and see what happens."
