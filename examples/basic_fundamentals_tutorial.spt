REM Step 1: Introduction
1000 PRINT "=== Step 1: Introduction to BASIC ==="
PRINT
PRINT "BASIC (Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)"
PRINT "is a classic programming language known for its simplicity."
PRINT
PRINT "Key features of BASIC:"
PRINT "• Line numbers organize the program"
PRINT "• LET assigns values to variables"
PRINT "• PRINT displays output"
PRINT "• INPUT gets user input"
PRINT "• Simple, English-like commands"
PRINT
PRINT "BASIC programs are easy to read and understand!"
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 2: First Program
1100 PRINT "=== Step 2: Your First BASIC Program ==="
PRINT
PRINT "BASIC programs use line numbers. Let's start simple:"
PRINT
PRINT "10 PRINT \"Hello, World!\""
PRINT "20 PRINT \"Welcome to BASIC programming!\""
PRINT "30 END"
PRINT
PRINT "How it works:"
PRINT "• Each line starts with a number (10, 20, 30)"
PRINT "• PRINT displays text on the screen"
PRINT "• END tells BASIC the program is finished"
PRINT "• Lines are executed in numerical order"
PRINT
PRINT "Try running this program!"
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 3: Variables
1200 PRINT "=== Step 3: Working with Variables ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Variables store information in BASIC programs."
PRINT
PRINT "Variable assignment example:"
PRINT
PRINT "10 LET X = 10"
PRINT "20 LET NAME$ = \"Alice\""
PRINT "30 PRINT \"X equals:\"; X"
PRINT "40 PRINT \"Name:\"; NAME$"
PRINT "50 END"
PRINT
PRINT "Variable rules:"
PRINT "• Numbers: X, SCORE, AGE"
PRINT "• Text (strings): NAME$, MESSAGE$ (end with $)"
PRINT "• LET assigns values"
PRINT "• PRINT displays variable values"
PRINT
PRINT "Variables remember their values throughout the program."
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 4: User Input
1300 PRINT "=== Step 4: Getting User Input ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Programs become interactive with INPUT statements."
PRINT
PRINT "Input example program:"
PRINT
PRINT "10 PRINT \"What's your name?\""
PRINT "20 INPUT NAME$"
PRINT "30 PRINT \"Hello, \"; NAME$; \"!\""
PRINT "40 PRINT \"How old are you?\""
PRINT "50 INPUT AGE"
PRINT "60 PRINT \"You are\"; AGE; \"years old.\""
PRINT "70 END"
PRINT
PRINT "INPUT syntax:"
PRINT "• INPUT variable - gets a number"
PRINT "• INPUT \"prompt\"; variable - shows a prompt"
PRINT "• For text input, use string variables (ending with $)"
PRINT
PRINT "Try entering different names and ages!"
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 5: Math Operations
1400 PRINT "=== Step 5: Mathematical Operations ==="
PRINT
PRINT "BASIC can perform calculations with variables."
PRINT
PRINT "Calculator program example:"
PRINT
PRINT "10 PRINT \"Simple Calculator\""
PRINT "20 INPUT \"First number: \"; A"
PRINT "30 INPUT \"Second number: \"; B"
PRINT "40 LET SUM = A + B"
PRINT "50 LET DIFFERENCE = A - B"

PRINT "90 PRINT \"Difference:\"; DIFFERENCE"
PRINT "100 PRINT \"Product:\"; PRODUCT"
PRINT "110 PRINT \"Quotient:\"; QUOTIENT"
PRINT "120 END"
PRINT
PRINT "Mathematical operators:"
PRINT "+  Addition"
PRINT "-  Subtraction"
PRINT "*  Multiplication"
PRINT "/  Division"
PRINT
PRINT "Operations follow standard mathematical precedence."

REM Step 6: Simple Programs

PRINT
PRINT "Temperature converter:"
