REM Step 1: Introduction
1000 PRINT "=== Step 1: Introduction to Logo Graphics ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Logo is famous for its turtle graphics system."
PRINT "Imagine a turtle with a pen that draws as it moves!"
PRINT
PRINT "The turtle understands commands like:"
PRINT "FORWARD - move forward"
PRINT "RIGHT - turn right"
PRINT "PENUP - lift the pen"
PRINT "PENDOWN - lower the pen"
PRINT
PRINT "Logo makes programming visual and fun!"
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 2: First Drawing
1100 PRINT "=== Step 2: Your First Logo Drawing ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Let's draw a simple line. Type this program:"
PRINT
PRINT "FORWARD 100"
PRINT
PRINT "Commands explained:"
PRINT "FORWARD 100 - move the turtle forward 100 units"
PRINT "The turtle draws a line as it moves!"
PRINT
PRINT "Try running this and see what happens."
PRINT "The turtle starts at the center of the screen."
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 3: Movement Commands
1200 PRINT "=== Step 3: Movement and Turning ==="
PRINT
PRINT "The turtle can move in different directions."
PRINT
PRINT "Complete movement example:"
PRINT
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT "RIGHT 90"
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT "RIGHT 90"
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT "RIGHT 90"
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT
PRINT "Movement commands:"
PRINT "FORWARD n (or FD n) - move forward n units"
PRINT "BACK n (or BK n) - move backward n units"
PRINT "RIGHT n (or RT n) - turn right n degrees"
PRINT "LEFT n (or LT n) - turn left n degrees"
PRINT
PRINT "This draws a square! Try changing the numbers."
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 4: Pen Control
1300 PRINT "=== Step 4: Controlling the Pen ==="
PRINT
PRINT "You can lift and lower the pen to control drawing."
PRINT
PRINT "Pen control example:"
PRINT
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT "PENUP"
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT "PENDOWN"
PRINT "FORWARD 50"
PRINT
PRINT "Pen commands:"
PRINT "PENUP (or PU) - lift pen, stop drawing"
PRINT "PENDOWN (or PD) - lower pen, start drawing"
PRINT "CLEARSCREEN (or CS) - clear screen"
PRINT "HOME - return turtle to center, facing up"
PRINT
PRINT "This creates a dashed line effect!"
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 5: Shapes
1400 PRINT "=== Step 5: Drawing Shapes ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Using loops to draw regular shapes."
PRINT
PRINT "Triangle:"
PRINT "REPEAT 3 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 120]"
PRINT
PRINT "Square:"
PRINT "REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]"
PRINT
PRINT "Pentagon:"
PRINT "REPEAT 5 [FORWARD 80 RIGHT 72]"
PRINT
PRINT "Hexagon:"
PRINT "REPEAT 6 [FORWARD 70 RIGHT 60]"
PRINT
PRINT "REPEAT command:"
PRINT "REPEAT n [commands] - repeat commands n times"
PRINT "Commands in brackets [] are repeated together"
PRINT
PRINT "Try drawing different shapes by changing the numbers!"
PRINT
RETURN

REM Step 6: Complex Patterns
1500 PRINT "=== Step 6: Complex Patterns and Procedures ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Logo can create beautiful complex patterns."
PRINT
PRINT "Spiral pattern:"
PRINT "REPEAT 50 [FORWARD REPCOUNT * 2 RIGHT 15]"
PRINT
PRINT "Star pattern:"
PRINT "REPEAT 5 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 144]"
PRINT
PRINT "Nested pattern:"
PRINT "REPEAT 8 ["
PRINT "  REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 50 RIGHT 90]"
PRINT "  RIGHT 45"
PRINT "]"
PRINT
PRINT "REPCOUNT - current repetition number (1, 2, 3...)"
PRINT "Nested REPEAT - loops inside loops"
PRINT
PRINT "Procedures for reusable code:"
PRINT "TO SQUARE"
PRINT "  REPEAT 4 [FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90]"
PRINT "END"
PRINT
PRINT "SQUARE (calls the procedure)"
PRINT

REM Step 7: Quiz
1600 PRINT "=== Step 7: Graphics Knowledge Check ==="
PRINT
PRINT "Let's test your Logo graphics knowledge!"
PRINT
LET QUIZ_SCORE = 0

PRINT "Question 1: What does FORWARD do?"
