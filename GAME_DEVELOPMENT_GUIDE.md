# üéÆ Time Warp Game Development Framework

## Overview

Time Warp now includes a comprehensive game development framework with advanced physics simulation, collision detection, and interactive graphics. This guide covers all aspects of creating games in Time Warp across all three supported languages: PILOT, BASIC, and Logo.

## Quick Start

### Basic Game Creation (PILOT)
```pilot
T:Creating my first game
GAME:CREATE player rectangle 100 100 32 48
GAME:CREATE enemy rectangle 200 150 24 24
GAME:PHYSICS GRAVITY 9.8
GAME:UPDATE 0.016
GAME:RENDER
```

### Basic Game Creation (BASIC)
```basic
10 PRINT "Creating my first game"
20 GAMECREATE player rectangle 100 100 32 48
30 GAMECREATE enemy rectangle 200 150 24 24
40 GAMEPHYSICS GRAVITY 9.8
50 GAMEUPDATE 0.016
60 GAMERENDER
```

### Basic Game Creation (Logo)
```logo
PRINT [Creating my first game]
CREATEOBJECT player rectangle 100 100 32 48
CREATEOBJECT enemy rectangle 200 150 24 24
SETGRAVITY 9.8
UPDATEGAME 0.016
RENDERGAME
```

## Game Framework Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Vector2D**: Mathematical foundation for 2D physics
2. **GameObject**: Represents all game entities with physics properties
3. **PhysicsEngine**: Handles gravity, velocity, acceleration, and collisions
4. **GameRenderer**: Renders objects to canvas (when available)
5. **GameManager**: Orchestrates all game systems

### Physics System

The physics engine supports:
- **Gravity**: Global downward acceleration (default: 9.8 m/s¬≤)
- **Velocity**: Object movement speed and direction
- **Acceleration**: Changes in velocity over time
- **Mass**: Affects how forces impact objects
- **Collision Detection**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision detection

## Game Object Types

### Rectangle Objects
- Standard rectangular collision boxes
- Most common for platforms, walls, characters
- Defined by x, y, width, height

### Circle Objects  
- Circular collision detection
- Good for balls, bullets, round objects
- Defined by x, y, radius (stored as width/height)

### Future Object Types
- **Sprite**: Image-based objects with animation
- **Platform**: Static objects with special collision behavior
- **Projectile**: Fast-moving objects with trail effects

## Coordinate System

- **Origin**: (0, 0) is at the screen center
- **X-Axis**: Positive right, negative left
- **Y-Axis**: Positive up, negative down (following physics convention)
- **Units**: Pixels for position, pixels/second for velocity

## Physics Properties

### Position and Movement
```pilot
GAME:CREATE ball circle 100 50 20 20
GAME:PHYSICS ball VELOCITY 10 -15  ; 10 right, 15 up
GAME:MOVE ball 5 0                  ; Move 5 pixels right
```

### Mass and Forces
```pilot
GAME:PHYSICS ball MASS 2.0         ; Heavier objects
GAME:PHYSICS GRAVITY 9.8           ; Earth-like gravity
```

### Collision Detection
```pilot
GAME:COLLISION CHECK player enemy RESULT
Y:RESULT = 1
T:Collision detected!
```

```

## Advanced Features

### Game Manager Dialog
Access the visual game development interface:
1. Go to **üéÆ Game Dev** menu
2. Select **Game Manager**
3. Use tabs for:
   - **üéØ Game Objects**: Create, edit, delete objects
   - **‚ö° Physics**: Control gravity and simulation
   - **üé® Scene Preview**: Visual representation of game world
   - **üöÄ Quick Demo**: Pre-built game templates

### Variable Integration
Game commands automatically create variables:
```pilot
GAME:CREATE player rectangle 100 100 32 32
T:Player X position: *GAME_PLAYER_X*
T:Player Y position: *GAME_PLAYER_Y*
T:Player velocity: (*GAME_PLAYER_VX*, *GAME_PLAYER_VY*)
```

### Physics Timing
- Use `GAME:UPDATE 0.016` for 60 FPS simulation
- Use `GAME:UPDATE 0.033` for 30 FPS simulation  
- Smaller timesteps = more accurate physics
- Larger timesteps = faster but less accurate

## Educational Concepts

### Physics Concepts Demonstrated
1. **Gravity**: Objects accelerate downward
2. **Velocity**: Speed and direction of movement
3. **Acceleration**: Change in velocity over time
4. **Collision Detection**: When objects overlap
5. **Conservation of Energy**: In bouncing balls
6. **Projectile Motion**: Parabolic trajectories

### Programming Concepts
1. **Object-Oriented Design**: Game objects with properties
2. **Event-Driven Programming**: Collision responses
3. **Game Loops**: Continuous update/render cycles
4. **State Management**: Tracking object properties
5. **Coordinate Systems**: 2D positioning
6. **Real-time Simulation**: Physics timesteps

## Performance Tips

### Optimization Strategies
1. **Limit Objects**: Don't create too many objects (< 50 recommended)
2. **Efficient Updates**: Only update active objects
3. **Collision Culling**: Only check nearby objects for collisions
4. **Render Batching**: Group similar objects for rendering
5. **Fixed Timestep**: Use consistent physics timing

### Best Practices
1. **Initialize Once**: Create objects at start, modify during gameplay
2. **Clear Unused**: Delete objects that are no longer needed
3. **Check Bounds**: Remove objects that leave the game area
4. **Validate Input**: Check collision results before using
5. **Handle Errors**: Use conditional checks for object existence

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Objects Not Moving**
```pilot
; Check if physics is being updated
GAME:UPDATE 0.016
; Check if object has velocity
GAME:PHYSICS player VELOCITY 10 0
```

**Collisions Not Detected**
```pilot
; Ensure objects exist
GAME:INFO player
GAME:INFO enemy
; Check positions are close enough
GAME:COLLISION CHECK player enemy RESULT
T:Collision result: *RESULT*
```

**Objects Falling Through Floor**
```pilot
; Create static platforms
GAME:CREATE floor rectangle 400 550 800 50
; Or check collision and stop movement
GAME:COLLISION CHECK player floor ONFLOOR
Y:ONFLOOR = 1
GAME:PHYSICS player VELOCITY *GAME_PLAYER_VX* 0
```

### Debug Information
```pilot
; Show all game objects
GAME:LIST
; Show object details
GAME:INFO player
; Show physics state
T:Gravity: *GAME_GRAVITY*
T:Objects: *GAME_OBJECT_COUNT*
```

## Integration with Other Features

3. **Particle Systems**: Visual effects like explosions and trails
4. **Advanced Physics**: Rotation, friction, bouncing
5. **Networking**: Multiplayer games over network
6. **Save/Load**: Persistent game states
7. **Scripting**: Custom game logic with events

### Contributing
The game framework is designed to be extensible. Key areas for enhancement:
- New object types in `GameObject` class
- Additional physics features in `PhysicsEngine`
- Enhanced rendering in `GameRenderer`
- More demo games in `_run_game_demo()`

## Conclusion

The Time Warp Game Development Framework provides a powerful yet educational platform for creating interactive games while learning programming and physics concepts. The integration across all three languages (PILOT, BASIC, Logo) ensures flexibility in teaching and learning approaches.

Whether creating simple collision detection demos or complex physics simulations, the framework provides the tools needed for engaging, educational game development experiences.
