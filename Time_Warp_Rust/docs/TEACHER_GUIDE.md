# Time Warp IDE - Teacher Guide

This guide provides lesson plans and activities for introducing PILOT, BASIC, and Logo using the Time Warp IDE.

## Overview

- Audience: Middle to high school students
- Duration: 6–10 sessions (45–60 minutes)
- Goals: Computational thinking, problem-solving, graphics fundamentals, simple game design

## Session Outline

1. Getting Started (PILOT)
   - Goals: Show text output, variables, input, branching via Y:/N:
   - Activities:
     - Run `examples/pilot_quiz.pilot`
     - Modify quiz questions and patterns
     - Use `U:VAR=VALUE` and `*VAR*` interpolation

2. Numeric Thinking (BASIC)
   - Goals: Expressions, variables, loops, conditionals
   - Activities:
     - Run `examples/basic_guess.bas`
     - Add attempt counter and hints
     - Try FOR/NEXT to generate sequences

3. Turtle Graphics (Logo)
   - Goals: Coordinates, angles, repetition, procedures
   - Activities:
     - Run `examples/logo_spirograph.logo`
     - Create a house with `examples/logo_house.logo`
     - Experiment with `REPEAT`, `PENWIDTH`, `SETCOLOR`

4. Project: Visual Patterns
   - Students design a geometric pattern using Logo procedures and nested repeats.

5. Project: Text Adventure
   - Extend `examples/pilot_adventure.pilot` with rooms, items, and puzzles.

## Assessment Ideas

- Rubrics for code readability, creativity, correctness
- Peer demo day with brief walkthroughs

## Tips

- Encourage incremental testing
- Have students narrate their logic before coding
- Use “Save Canvas as PNG…” to collect visual outputs
