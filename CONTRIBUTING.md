# Contributing to Time Warp IDE

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please take a moment to read this guide.

## Development Workflow

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
- Keep changes focused and incremental. Prefer small PRs.
- Run tests locally before pushing.
- Ensure formatting and linting pass for Rust code.

## Code Style

- Rust: rustfmt, clippy

## Commit Messages

Use conventional commits when possible:

- feat: new feature
- fix: bug fix
- docs: documentation only changes
- refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- test: adding or updating tests
- chore: tooling and maintenance

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Tests added/updated where relevant
- [ ] Docs updated (README/USER_GUIDE/DEVELOPMENT)
- [ ] CI passes (Rust)
- [ ] No broken lints or format checks

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue with a clear description, steps to reproduce, and expected behavior. Include logs or screenshots if applicable.
