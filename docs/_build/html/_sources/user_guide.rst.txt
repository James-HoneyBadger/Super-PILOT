User Guide
==========

Welcome to Time Warp IDE! This comprehensive guide will help you master the educational programming environment.

Overview
--------

Time Warp IDE is a comprehensive educational programming environment that supports three integrated programming languages:

* **PILOT** - A teaching language designed for computer-assisted instruction
* **BASIC** - Classic structured programming constructs
* **Logo** - Turtle graphics and procedural programming

Getting Started
---------------

Running Time Warp IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 Time_Warp.py

Basic Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main interface consists of several key components:

* **Editor Tab**: Write your programs using any combination of PILOT, BASIC, and Logo commands
* **Output Tab**: View program execution results
* **Watch Variables Tab**: Monitor variable values during execution
* **Tutorials Tab**: Access interactive learning materials
* **Exercises Tab**: Practice programming challenges

Language Reference
------------------

PILOT Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PILOT (Programmed Instruction, Learning, Or Teaching) is designed for educational programming:

* ``T:text`` - Output text (supports ``*VARIABLE*`` interpolation)
* ``A:variable`` - Accept input into variable
* ``Y:condition`` - Set match flag if condition is true
* ``N:condition`` - Alternative conditional test
* ``J:label`` - Jump to label (conditional if follows Y:/N:)
* ``M:label`` - Jump to label if match flag is set
* ``R:label`` - Gosub to label (subroutine call)
* ``C:`` - Return from subroutine
* ``L:label`` - Label definition
* ``U:var=expr`` - Update/assign variable
* ``END`` - End program

BASIC Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

BASIC provides classic structured programming constructs:

* ``LET var = expr`` - Variable assignment
* ``PRINT expr`` - Output expression or string
* ``INPUT var`` - Get user input
* ``GOTO line`` - Jump to line number
* ``IF condition THEN command`` - Conditional execution
* ``FOR var = start TO end [STEP step]`` - Loop construct
* ``NEXT [var]`` - End of FOR loop
* ``GOSUB line`` - Call subroutine
* ``RETURN`` - Return from subroutine
* ``REM comment`` - Comment line
* ``END`` - End program

Logo Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Logo excels at turtle graphics programming:

* ``FORWARD n`` (or ``FD n``) - Move turtle forward
* ``BACK n`` (or ``BK n``) - Move turtle backward
* ``LEFT n`` (or ``LT n``) - Turn turtle left
* ``RIGHT n`` (or ``RT n``) - Turn turtle right
* ``PENUP`` (or ``PU``) - Lift pen up
* ``PENDOWN`` (or ``PD``) - Put pen down
* ``CLEARSCREEN`` (or ``CS``) - Clear screen
* ``HOME`` - Return turtle to center
* ``SETXY x y`` - Set turtle position

Built-in Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Common functions available across all languages:

* ``RND()`` - Random number (0-1)
* ``INT(expr)`` - Convert to integer
* ``VAL(string)`` - Convert string to number
* ``UPPER(string)`` - Convert to uppercase
* ``LOWER(string)`` - Convert to lowercase
* ``MID(string,start,length)`` - Extract substring

Advanced Features
-----------------

Debugging
~~~~~~~~~

Time Warp IDE provides powerful debugging tools:

* Set breakpoints by clicking in the line number area
* Use **Step** to execute one line at a time
* Use **Continue** to run until the next breakpoint
* Monitor variables in the Watch Variables tab

Version Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Automatic version saving before each run
* Access version history through File â†’ Version History

Educational Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Interactive tutorials for each language
* Programming exercises with automatic checking
* Comprehensive help system
* Example programs included

Example Programs
----------------

Hello World (PILOT)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

   L:START
   T:Hello, World!
   T:This is Time Warp!
   END

Math Demo (Mixed Languages)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

   REM This is a BASIC comment
   LET A = 15
   LET B = 25
   PRINT "A = "; A; ", B = "; B

   L:PILOT_SECTION
   U:SUM=*A*+*B*
   T:Sum using PILOT: *SUM*
   END

Simple Drawing (Logo)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: none

   CLEARSCREEN
   PENDOWN
   FORWARD 50
   RIGHT 90
   FORWARD 50
   RIGHT 90

* ``.pil`` - PILOT program files

Troubleshooting
---------------

Common Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. **Import errors**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed with tkinter support
2. **Missing Pillow**: Install with ``pip install pillow``
3. **Display issues**: Ensure your system supports GUI applications
