20 LET FUTURE = AGE + 10  REM Calculate future age
30 PRINT "In 10 years, you'll be "; FUTURE; " years old!"
```

#### **🧮 Math Magic with BASIC**
```templecode
10 PRINT "=== Amazing Math Calculator ==="
20 LET A = 15
30 LET B = 7
40 PRINT A; " + "; B; " = "; A + B
50 PRINT A; " - "; B; " = "; A - B
60 PRINT A; " × "; B; " = "; A * B
70 PRINT A; " ÷ "; B; " = "; A / B
```

#### **🎯 Practice Challenge: Age Calculator**
Create a program that:
1. Asks for your birth year
2. Calculates your current age
3. Shows how old you'll be in 2030

**Hint**: Use the current year (2025) in your calculation!

### 🗣️ **PILOT - The Conversation Expert**

PILOT makes it easy to:
- Ask questions and get answers
- Create interactive dialogues

## 💾 Level 2: Memory and Variables

### 🧠 **Teaching Your Program to Remember**

Imagine if you had a magical backpack with labeled pockets where you could store anything and find it later. Variables are like those labeled pockets for your programs!

#### **📦 Variable Basics**
```templecode
REM BASIC variables - like labeled boxes
10 LET FAVORITE_COLOR$ = "purple"    REM Text goes in string variables
20 LET LUCKY_NUMBER = 7              REM Numbers go in numeric variables
30 LET PI = 3.14159                  REM Decimals are numbers too!

REM PILOT variables - conversation memory
T:What's your pet's name?
A:$PET_NAME                          REM Stores what you type

REM Logo variables - temporary helpers
TO DRAW_CIRCLE :SIZE                 REM SIZE is a parameter variable
  REPEAT 360 [FORWARD 1 RIGHT 1]    REM Creates a circle
END
```

#### **🎯 Memory Game Challenge**
Let's create a program that remembers everything about you:

```templecode
10 PRINT "=== All About Me - Memory Master ==="

T:I'm going to remember lots of things about you!
T:What's your first name?
A:$FIRST_NAME

T:What's your last name?
A:$LAST_NAME

T:How old are you?
A:$AGE_INPUT
20 LET AGE = VAL(AGE_INPUT)

T:What's your favorite number?
A:$FAV_NUM_INPUT  
30 LET FAVORITE_NUMBER = VAL(FAV_NUM_INPUT)

T:What's your favorite color?
A:$FAVORITE_COLOR

REM Now let's use everything we remembered!
40 PRINT "========== MEMORY REPORT =========="
50 PRINT "Name: "; FIRST_NAME; " "; LAST_NAME
60 PRINT "Age: "; AGE; " years old"
70 PRINT "Favorite number: "; FAVORITE_NUMBER
80 PRINT "Favorite color: "; FAVORITE_COLOR

REM Let's do some math with the numbers!
90 LET NEXT_YEAR = AGE + 1
100 LET DOUBLE_FAV = FAVORITE_NUMBER * 2
110 PRINT "Next year you'll be: "; NEXT_YEAR
120 PRINT "Your favorite number doubled: "; DOUBLE_FAV

REM Let's draw something with your favorite color!
SETCOLOR FAVORITE_COLOR
PENWIDTH 3
REPEAT FAVORITE_NUMBER [
  FORWARD 20
  RIGHT 360 / FAVORITE_NUMBER
]

T:I remembered everything perfectly!
T:Your *FAVORITE_COLOR* pattern has *FAV_NUM_INPUT* sides!
```

### 🧮 **Number Magic and Math**

Numbers in programming can do amazing things! Let's explore the mathematical superpowers:

#### **➕ Basic Math Operations**
```templecode
10 PRINT "=== Number Magic Show ==="
20 LET A = 15
30 LET B = 4

40 PRINT A; " + "; B; " = "; A + B         REM Addition: 19
50 PRINT A; " - "; B; " = "; A - B         REM Subtraction: 11  
60 PRINT A; " × "; B; " = "; A * B         REM Multiplication: 60
70 PRINT A; " ÷ "; B; " = "; A / B         REM Division: 3.75
80 PRINT A; " mod "; B; " = "; A MOD B     REM Remainder: 3
```

#### **🎯 Order of Operations**
Just like in math class, programming follows PEMDAS:

```templecode
10 LET RESULT1 = 2 + 3 * 4        REM = 14 (not 20!)
20 LET RESULT2 = (2 + 3) * 4      REM = 20 (parentheses first)
30 LET RESULT3 = 10 + 6 / 2       REM = 13 (division before addition)
40 LET RESULT4 = (10 + 6) / 2     REM = 8 (parentheses change everything)

50 PRINT "2 + 3 × 4 = "; RESULT1
60 PRINT "(2 + 3) × 4 = "; RESULT2
70 PRINT "10 + 6 ÷ 2 = "; RESULT3  
80 PRINT "(10 + 6) ÷ 2 = "; RESULT4
```

#### **🧙‍♂️ Mathematical Functions**
```templecode
10 PRINT "=== Math Magic Functions ==="
20 LET NUMBER = -7.8

30 PRINT "ABS("; NUMBER; ") = "; ABS(NUMBER)     REM Absolute value: 7.8
40 PRINT "INT("; NUMBER; ") = "; INT(NUMBER)     REM Integer part: -7
50 PRINT "SQR(64) = "; SQR(64)                   REM Square root: 8
60 PRINT "RND = "; RND                           REM Random 0-1: 0.234...

70 LET RANDOM_1_TO_10 = INT(RND * 10) + 1
80 PRINT "Random 1-10: "; RANDOM_1_TO_10
```

#### **🎮 Project: Super Calculator**
Create the ultimate calculator program:

```templecode

50 PRINT A; " + "; B; " = "; A + B
60 PRINT A; " - "; B; " = "; A - B  
70 PRINT A; " × "; B; " = "; A * B
80 IF B <> 0 THEN PRINT A; " ÷ "; B; " = "; A / B
90 IF B = 0 THEN PRINT "Cannot divide by zero!"

REM Visual bar graph of results
SETCOLOR green
FORWARD (A + B) / 2    REM Draw sum divided by 2 for size
J:CALCULATOR_START

*RANDOM_NUMBERS
T:How many random numbers do you want (1-10)?
A:$COUNT_INPUT
100 LET COUNT = VAL(COUNT_INPUT)
110 IF COUNT < 1 OR COUNT > 10 THEN J:BAD_COUNT

120 PRINT "Here are your "; COUNT; " random numbers:"
130 FOR I = 1 TO COUNT
140   LET RANDOM_NUM = INT(RND * 100) + 1
150   PRINT "Random #"; I; ": "; RANDOM_NUM
160 NEXT I
J:CALCULATOR_START

*BAD_COUNT
T:Please enter a number between 1 and 10!
J:RANDOM_NUMBERS

REM Continue implementing other calculator features...
```

### 📝 **Playing with Words**

Strings (text) variables are amazing for creating interactive stories and programs!

#### **🔤 String Superpowers**
```templecode
10 PRINT "=== String Magic ==="
20 LET FIRST$ = "Hello"
30 LET LAST$ = "World"
40 LET COMBINED$ = FIRST$ + " " + LAST$ + "!"
50 PRINT COMBINED$                    REM "Hello World!"

60 LET LENGTH = LEN(COMBINED$)        REM Length: 12
70 LET PART$ = LEFT$(COMBINED$, 5)    REM First 5 characters: "Hello"
80 LET END$ = RIGHT$(COMBINED$, 6)    REM Last 6 characters: "World!"

90 PRINT "Length: "; LENGTH
100 PRINT "First part: "; PART$
110 PRINT "Last part: "; END$
```

#### **🎭 Interactive Story Generator**
```templecode
10 PRINT "=== Mad Lib Story Generator ==="

T:Let's create a funny story together!
T:Give me an adjective (describing word):
A:$ADJECTIVE

T:Give me a noun (person, place, or thing):
A:$NOUN

T:Give me a verb (action word):
A:$VERB

T:Give me a color:
A:$COLOR

T:Give me a number:
A:$NUMBER

REM Create the story
20 LET STORY1$ = "Once upon a time, there was a " + ADJECTIVE
30 LET STORY2$ = " " + NOUN + " who loved to " + VERB + "."
40 LET STORY3$ = " Every day, they would wear " + COLOR 
50 LET STORY4$ = " clothes and count to " + NUMBER + "."
60 LET FULL_STORY$ = STORY1$ + STORY2$ + STORY3$ + STORY4$

70 PRINT "========== YOUR STORY =========="
80 PRINT FULL_STORY$

REM Draw a picture to go with the story
SETCOLOR COLOR
REPEAT VAL(NUMBER) [
  FORWARD 10
  RIGHT 360 / VAL(NUMBER)
]

T:What a *ADJECTIVE* story about a *NOUN*!
```

#### **🎯 Challenge: Word Games**

## 🎮 Level 3: Making Decisions

### 🤔 **Teaching Programs to Think**

Just like you make decisions every day (what to wear, what to eat, which game to play), programs can make decisions too! This is called **conditional logic** - fancy words for "IF this, THEN that."

#### **🔍 The Magic of IF Statements**
```templecode
REM Simple decision making
10 LET AGE = 15
20 IF AGE >= 13 THEN PRINT "You're a teenager!"
30 IF AGE < 13 THEN PRINT "You're still a kid!"

REM Multiple conditions
40 IF AGE >= 18 THEN PRINT "You can vote!"
50 IF AGE >= 16 AND AGE < 18 THEN PRINT "You can drive!"
60 IF AGE < 16 THEN PRINT "A few more years until driving!"
```

#### **🎯 Your First Smart Program**
Let's create a program that gives different responses based on your answers:

```templecode
10 PRINT "=== Personality Quiz ==="

T:What's your favorite season?
T:(spring, summer, fall, winter)
A:$SEASON

M:spring: T:You love new beginnings and fresh starts!
M:summer: T:You enjoy sunshine and outdoor adventures!
M:fall,autumn: T:You appreciate change and cozy feelings!
M:winter: T:You find beauty in quiet, peaceful times!
M:*: T:Every season has something special!

T:What's your favorite time of day?
A:$TIME_OF_DAY

M:morning: T:You're an early bird who loves fresh starts!
M:afternoon: T:You enjoy the busy, active part of the day!
M:evening: T:You like winding down and relaxing!
M:night: T:You're a night owl who loves the quiet darkness!

REM Combine the answers for a personality profile
20 IF SEASON = "summer" AND TIME_OF_DAY = "morning" THEN GOSUB 1000
30 IF SEASON = "winter" AND TIME_OF_DAY = "night" THEN GOSUB 2000
REM Add more combinations...

*1000 REM Summer morning person
T:You're an energetic adventurer who loves to start each day with excitement!
SETCOLOR yellow
REPEAT 8 [FORWARD 30 RIGHT 45]  REM Draw a sun
RETURN

*2000 REM Winter night person  
T:You're a thoughtful dreamer who finds peace in quiet moments!
SETCOLOR blue
REPEAT 6 [FORWARD 40 RIGHT 60]  REM Draw a snowflake pattern
RETURN
```

### 🎲 **Creating Smart Programs**

Let's build programs that can handle different situations and make smart choices!

#### **🎮 Number Guessing Game with Hints**
```templecode
10 PRINT "🎯 === SUPER GUESSING GAME === 🎯"
20 LET SECRET = INT(RND * 50) + 1
30 LET GUESSES = 0
40 LET MAX_GUESSES = 7

T:I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 50!
T:You have 7 guesses to find it. Good luck!

*GUESS_LOOP
50 LET GUESSES = GUESSES + 1
60 LET REMAINING = MAX_GUESSES - GUESSES + 1

T:Guess #*GUESSES* - What's your guess?
A:$GUESS_INPUT
70 LET GUESS = VAL(GUESS_INPUT)

REM Check if they won
80 IF GUESS = SECRET THEN J:YOU_WIN

REM Check if they're out of guesses
90 IF GUESSES >= MAX_GUESSES THEN J:GAME_OVER

REM Give helpful hints
100 IF GUESS < SECRET THEN T:Too low! Try a bigger number.
110 IF GUESS > SECRET THEN T:Too high! Try a smaller number.

REM Extra hints based on how close they are
120 LET DIFFERENCE = ABS(GUESS - SECRET)
130 IF DIFFERENCE <= 3 THEN T:🔥 You're really close!
140 IF DIFFERENCE > 3 AND DIFFERENCE <= 8 THEN T:😊 You're getting warm!
150 IF DIFFERENCE > 8 THEN T:❄️ You're cold - try a very different number!

T:You have *REMAINING* guesses left.

```

### 🎯 **Challenge Projects**

#### **Project 1: Smart Pet Care Game**
Create a virtual pet that needs different care based on its status:

```templecode
REM Pet stats
10 LET HUNGER = 50     REM 0-100 scale
20 LET HAPPINESS = 75  REM 0-100 scale  
30 LET ENERGY = 60     REM 0-100 scale
40 LET PET_NAME$ = ""

REM Get pet name and show initial status
REM Create menu system with options:
REM 1. Feed pet (increases hunger, costs energy)
REM 2. Play with pet (increases happiness, costs energy)
REM 3. Let pet sleep (increases energy, decreases happiness slightly)
REM 4. Check pet status (show all stats with graphics)
REM 5. Pet hospital (if any stat is too low)

REM Use IF statements to determine pet's mood and needs
REM Create visual representations of pet's condition
```

#### **Project 2: Weather Advisory System**
Build a program that gives advice based on weather conditions:

```templecode
REM Ask about temperature, precipitation, wind
REM Use complex IF statements to determine:
REM - What clothes to wear
REM - What activities are good
REM - Any weather warnings
REM - Fun facts about the weather

REM Include graphics showing weather conditions
```

#### **Project 3: Study Buddy Scheduler** 
Create a smart scheduler that helps plan study time:

```templecode
REM Ask about:
REM - How many subjects
REM - How much time available  
REM - Difficulty level of each subject
REM - Upcoming test dates

REM Use logic to:
REM - Allocate time fairly
REM - Prioritize based on difficulty and test dates
REM - Suggest break times
REM - Create visual schedule
```

## 🔄 Level 4: Loops and Patterns

### 🎪 **Making Things Repeat**

Imagine if you had to write "I will practice programming" 100 times by hand - that would take forever! Loops are like having a magical helper that can repeat tasks for you perfectly, every time.

#### **🔁 The Magic of REPEAT**
```templecode
REM Instead of writing this:
FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 50  
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90
FORWARD 50
RIGHT 90

REM You can write this:
REPEAT 4 [
  FORWARD 50
  RIGHT 90
]

REM Both draw a square, but the second way is much smarter!
```

#### **🎯 Your First Loop Adventures**

**Loop Adventure 1: Counting Up**
```templecode
10 PRINT "=== Blast Off Countdown ==="
20 FOR COUNT = 10 TO 1 STEP -1
30   PRINT "T-minus "; COUNT; " seconds..."
40 NEXT COUNT
50 PRINT "🚀 BLAST OFF! 🚀"

REM Draw rocket with loop-generated flames
SETCOLOR red
60 FOR FLAME = 1 TO 20
70   FORWARD FLAME
80   BACK FLAME
90   RIGHT 18
100 NEXT FLAME
```

**Loop Adventure 2: Pattern Power**
```templecode
REM Create a growing pattern
SETCOLOR blue
10 FOR SIZE = 10 TO 100 STEP 10
20   REPEAT 6 [
30     FORWARD SIZE
40     RIGHT 60
50   ]
60   PENUP
70   FORWARD 5
80   PENDOWN
90 NEXT SIZE

T:Look! Each hexagon is bigger than the last!
```

#### **🌟 Loop Types - Choose Your Adventure**

**FOR Loops - When You Know How Many Times**
```templecode
REM Perfect for counting
10 FOR I = 1 TO 5
20   PRINT "This is number "; I
30 NEXT I

REM Great for mathematical sequences  
40 FOR NUM = 0 TO 20 STEP 2
50   PRINT NUM; " is an even number"
60 NEXT NUM

REM Awesome for patterns
70 FOR STARS = 1 TO 5
80   FOR J = 1 TO STARS
90     PRINT "*";
100   NEXT J
110   PRINT ""
120 NEXT STARS
REM Creates:
REM *
REM **
REM ***
REM ****
REM *****
```

**REPEAT Loops - For Simple Repetition**
```templecode
REM Perfect for turtle graphics
REPEAT 8 [
  FORWARD 50
  RIGHT 45
]

REM Great for simple patterns
REPEAT 360 [
  FORWARD 1
  RIGHT 1
]
REM Draws a perfect circle!
```

**WHILE Loops - When You Don't Know How Many Times**
```templecode
10 PRINT "Keep going until you get it right!"
20 LET CORRECT = 0
30 WHILE CORRECT = 0
40   INPUT "What is 7 × 8? ", ANSWER
50   IF ANSWER = 56 THEN LET CORRECT = 1
60   IF ANSWER <> 56 THEN PRINT "Try again!"
70 WEND
80 PRINT "Correct! Great job!"
```

### 🎨 **Creating Amazing Patterns**

Loops are the secret to creating incredible art and patterns!

#### **🌈 Rainbow Spiral**
```templecode
10 PRINT "🌈 Creating a Rainbow Spiral! 🌈"

REM Set up rainbow colors
20 DIM COLORS$(7)
30 COLORS$(1) = "red"

80 COLORS$(6) = "indigo"
90 COLORS$(7) = "violet"

REM Create the rainbow spiral
100 FOR TURN = 1 TO 140
110   LET COLOR_INDEX = (TURN MOD 7) + 1
120   SETCOLOR COLORS$(COLOR_INDEX)
