### Parent Communication

**Welcome Email Template**:
```
Dear Parents,

Your child will be learning programming in our 8-week course using
Time Warp IDE. They'll explore three classic programming languages:
PILOT, BASIC, and Logo.

No prior experience needed! We'll start with basics and build up to
creating games and computer art.

How you can help:
- Encourage your child to experiment at home
- Ask them to show you what they're working on
- Celebrate both successes and learning from errors

The software is free and open source. Install at home from:
https://github.com/James-HoneyBadger/Time_Warp

Looking forward to a great semester!
```
