## � What is TempleCode?

TempleCode is a revolutionary programming language that unifies three classic educational languages into one cohesive experience:

### 🔢 BASIC Features
```basic
10 PRINT "Welcome to Time Warp!"
20 LET X = 42
30 FOR I = 1 TO 5
40   PRINT "Count: "; I
50 NEXT I
60 IF X > 40 THEN PRINT "X is large"
```

### 🎭 PILOT Features  
```pilot
T:What is your name?
A:$NAME
T:Hello, $NAME! Nice to meet you.
M:yes,y: *YES
M:no,n: *NO
T:Do you like programming? (yes/no)
A:$ANSWER
Y: T:Great! Let's start coding.
N: T:No worries, we'll take it slow.
```

### 🐢 Logo Features
```logo
TO FLOWER :SIZE
  REPEAT 8 [
    SETCOLOR (RANDOM 256) (RANDOM 256) (RANDOM 256)
    REPEAT 36 [
      FORWARD :SIZE
      RIGHT 10
    ]
    RIGHT 45
  ]
END

FLOWER 50
```

### 🌟 Mixed Programming
```templecode
10 PRINT "Creating a colorful spiral"
20 LET SIZE = 100

T:Starting turtle graphics demo
SETCOLOR red
PENWIDTH 3

30 FOR I = 1 TO 10
40   FORWARD SIZE
50   RIGHT 36
60   LET SIZE = SIZE * 0.9
70 NEXT I
