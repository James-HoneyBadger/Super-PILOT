SuperPILOT Graphics Fix - October 28, 2025
==========================================

PROBLEM REPORTED
----------------
Graphics not working - nothing shows even for valid commands

ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
---------------------
Turtle graphics were initializing at position (200, 200) in logical 
coordinates instead of (0, 0). Since the coordinate transform adds
origin_x + turtle_x, this resulted in:
  - Canvas X = 200 + 200 = 400
  - Canvas Y = 200 + 200 = 400

With a 400x400 canvas, drawings started at the edge/outside the visible area.

FIX APPLIED
-----------
Changed turtle initialization from (200, 200) to (0, 0) in logical coordinates:

1. Updated reset_turtle() method:
   - turtle_x = 0 (was 200)
   - turtle_y = 0 (was 200)

2. Updated __init__ default values:
   - turtle_x = 0 (was 200)  
   - turtle_y = 0 (was 200)

The origin_x and origin_y remain at (200, 200) for canvas center mapping.

COORDINATE SYSTEM EXPLAINED
----------------------------
Logical coordinates (turtle space):
  - (0, 0) = center of canvas
  - Positive X = right
  - Positive Y = up
  - Heading 90° = up (north)

Canvas coordinates (tkinter space):
  - (0, 0) = top-left corner
  - Positive X = right
  - Positive Y = down

Transform: canvas_x = origin_x + turtle_x
          canvas_y = origin_y - turtle_y  (note the minus)

VERIFICATION RESULTS
--------------------
✓ Tk installed and available
✓ Turtle movement calculations correct
✓ Graphics display working
✓ All 4 sides of square drawn
✓ All lines within visible canvas area
✓ Window shows square correctly

TEST PROGRAMS
-------------
1. test_graphics.py - Basic canvas test
2. verify_graphics.py - Comprehensive verification
3. graphics_demo.spt - Sample PILOT program with graphics

BEFORE FIX:
Square drawn at coords [400-500] - outside visible 0-400 range

AFTER FIX:
Square drawn at coords [200-300] - centered and visible!

STATUS: ✅ FIXED
Graphics now display correctly in SuperPILOT IDE.
